              <h3>Team Reflection</h3>
              <p>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of
              your ideal job changed? Why/Why not?</p>
              <div class="sub-section">
                <h4>Catt:</h4>
                <p>After carefully reviewing my listed skills in the Burning Glass Rank, I would still affirm that my ideal job
                   has not been altered and I will always try my best to progress my future career to the Senior Systems
                   Administrator. Moreover, IT is my passion so I would love to be the one who helps others with their
                   problems/complications in the IT field. Additionally, if I follow my passion for IT now, it will eventually
                   lead me to the progressively level path in the IT field career shortly. Besides, considering that I have
                   already acquired some of the very important skills such as organisational skills, problem-solving skills,
                   and attention to detail, these can be exceptionally supportive while combining both soft and hard skills,
                   along with my passion, and how much I will enjoy, I believe that is the key for the first step to finding my
                   dream job. As a result, it motivates me to learn and study Information Technology with the intention that
                   I can be anything I want and do whatever I am keen to do in the future.
                </p>

                <h4>Liz:</h4>
                <p>My opinion of my chosen ideal job (Front End Developer) hasn’t
                  really changed. I think there will always be a need for this role
                  even if it is not the #1 in-demand job. I am already on my way to
                  gaining several of the required skill both generic and tech-specific
                  and think it would be a good fit. However, while this seems like an
                  easy choice for me, I have interests in other areas as well that I
                  would like to explore. Cloud security is one that I am interested
                  to learn more about, even though it wasn’t initially in the 2018
                  data reports top 25, more recent predictions have shown cloud-related
                  roles, such as cloud security and cloud architect gaining higher
                  demand, and from what I have read recently, it is going to become
                  more important still as many businesses have been making the move
                  to cloud services since the beginning of the pandemic. It also
                  appears that women are heavily under-represented in that sector,
                  meaning that more opportunities would arise for me from organisations
                  that are looking to create inclusive teams, which is the kind of
                  environment I would want to work in no matter which role I aspire to.

                <p>Yes and No. I still hold that the job I’m working towards will
                   give me the outcomes and fulfilment I’m looking for. However,
                   after looking at the data I start to wonder what I’m missing
                   out on by only focusing on a singular pathway. For me, my ideal
                   job has not changed, but rather the definition of what is ideal
                   for myself has shifted and I’m beginning to plan a longer career
                   pathway into opportunities past the mid/senior software engineer
                   in game design hopefully leading to more responsibility,
                   opportunity and reward.
