          <h2>Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies</h2>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin dominate the headlines, although the technology underpinning is not often given the same limelight.
            Yet to fully understand Cryptocurrency, you will first need to understand what is known as “The Blockchain”. 
            Despite its recent popularity, The Blockchain was first proposed in 1982 by David Chaum. 
            It began as a technology to ensure timestamps could not be tampered during record-keeping, in essence The Blockchain is a digital ledger.
            To ensure the upmost integrity of records, many blockchains are publicly available to be accessed, this is called a distributed ledger and the purpose is it makes it difficult to disrupt a past record without such an attempt being noticed.
            This is achieved by having many copies of the same ledger being shared across many systems and cross checks being performed as new data is added, this becomes decentralised instead of relying on one centralised database which could be vulnerable to infiltration or corruption.
            As more copies of the list are actively part of the system, its security increases as the ledger is checked and rechecked with each-other to provide the most structurally secured version of events. 
            The name comes from each data point being referred to as a 'block'.
            A block contains three pieces of information, firstly is a unique identity code specific to that block (called as hash) and secondly it contained the hash of the previous block, this allows it to be placed correctly in the order of events, this is where the 'chain' from blockchain comes from, as each is strung together one after the other. Finally, the third piece of information is the actual data itself.
            The contents of this data depend on the purpose of the blockchain, for example in cryptocurrency it can be a transactional receipt of X sending coin to Y. 
            The linear fashion of a blockchain has many use cases for securing and verifying data, but it became uniquely suited for the invention of an all-digital decentralised currency. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrency as we know it today was proposed in 2008 under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, it is unknown if this refers to a single or group of people and much like Princess Anastasia, many have come forward claiming to be the true Nakamoto, although to this day the truth is yet to be revealed. 
            Cryptocurrency’s (or simply 'Crypto') are digital currencies which operate using Blockchain Technology on a mass scale, the blocks are used to represent coins and transactions, each coin is part of a whole, there’s often a total number of coins that are available within a coin which adds to its scarcity. 
            Crypto is designed as an alternative to traditional currency, where you have a digital wallet from which you can earn and spend your coin as would be common with traditional currency.
            The decentralised and largely unregulated nature of crypto has given rise to the question regarding the motives behind using it in terms of its usage for crime, either a direct transactional crime such as the sale of illicit drugs or financial crime in terms of money laundering.
            It could be seen as evidence that in 2014 when the .onion drug marketplace of The Silk Road being seized by American authorities, this causing a direct and notable dip sudden of Bitcoin's value by 24%, indicating the purpose at the time many had for using the coin.
            Although it is worth noting that the value quickly bounced back and as a rule, cryptocurrencies are extraordinarily volatile by nature.
            A prime example of this can be seen for when multibillionaire Elon Musk tweets something even passingly negative about Bitcoin, that alone causes an intense crash in value due to its inherently reactionary market.
            <br>
            Ironically in the case of coins like Bitcoin it is not as privacy-enabling as some might believe.
            Since the Blockchain is a publicly viewed ledger, it can also include traceable transactional history.
            In Australia as a requirement from the financial regulator (AUSTRAC), that companies in Australia who sell coins through exchange must keep their own records of which coins were sold to whom, so that in theory a coin could be potentially traced back through the blockchain to an individual who purchased them using conventional currency.
