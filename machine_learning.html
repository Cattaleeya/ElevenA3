          <p>What does it do? <br>
            Machine learning (ML) is a method of data analysis that
            collects a large amount of data using an algorithm to predict
            and refine outcomes that usually involve interaction with
            end-users (Davenport n.d.). It is also a branch of artificial
            intelligence (AI) based on the idea that systems can learn from
            data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human
            intervention. Machine learning teaches computers to think in a
            similar way to how humans do (IBM Cloud Education 2020).
          </p>

          <!-- </div>-->


            <p>Machines follow instructions given by humans who train them
              to do things like actual humans do and unsurprisingly, to learn; 
              therefore, this is the reason why we called them ‘machine learning’.
              It learns from the data which has been built to predict the model 
              accurately. Therefore, when the new data point comes in, it can 
              easily predict. It has been proven that the more data input, the 
              more accurate it will be (Davenport n.d.). 
          </p>

          <ul>Machine Learning (ML) can be described into three types of models, 
            according to Brooks & Dahlke (2017), as followed:
<li>	Supervised Learning – where the data was labelled and used as a training set to teach the machine until the precise results have been accepted. Teaching a machine to recognise breeds of dogs using pictures could be an example of whether they could identify and acknowledge the various species of dogs from other animals or not. The advantage of this approach is better system control and accuracy; however, this approach could be laborious, considering how much time you need to put in with labelling. 
<li>	Unsupervised Learning – where the data was unlabelled and the model is never trained upon the given dataset, which means it does not have any idea about features of the dataset; therefore, it needs to identify the images feature on their own. However, even though it is good that no humans are involved in the process, it could easily make errors because of the lack of human interaction with the machine. 
<li>	Reinforcement Learning – this approach is different from the other models as it learns and improves from its feedback as well as experiences. Thus, it will balance itself by what they did good or not and what should be done to improve themselves. However, data inputs will be required to ensure that the machine will receive the proper feedback.

            </ul></div>
          <p>Machine learning has been used everywhere. For instance, using machine learning for diagnostics in healthcare to assist doctors to predict and review patient cases (Kovalenko & Chuprina n.d.), using machine learning on social media to detect spam or fraud (Board Infinity 2019), using machine learning in finance/banking sector, Netflix to predict what kind of movies/series you like based on your previous review, Google, Voice Command or recognition (Sponsor News 2021), Face recognition (PXL Vision 2021), Robot vacuums, driverless car, ATM, uber to predict where is the most customer nearby so it can be available in that area (Robinson 2019), which have been involved in everyone daily at the present day.
