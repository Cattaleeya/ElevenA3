          <h2>Team Personality Profile</h2>
          <p>
          Based on the Myers-Briggs personality test, half of the group shared the same type, that being of the <b>Turbulent Mediator</b> (INFP-T).
          The Mediator trait is often for those with deeper inner thoughts.
          While sometimes quiet on the outside, inside they’re vibrant and imaginative.
          They often have a great deal of empathy towards others and process an easy willingness (to the point of compelled) to help others achieve their goals, as such they often find themselves acting in support roles.
          They’re unlikely to willingly put themselves at the center of attention but help those who do.
          The Turbulent variety of Mediator often is found to have put too much on their own plate, willing to take on large workloads and often as a result can become overwhelmed by the multitude of tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Turbulent type could be found again in another member who instead was a <b>Virtuoso</b> (ISTP-T).
           Virtuosos’ like Mediator’s tend to have an internal thought mindset, although tending to prefer working on their own and often have a strong independent nature.
           They’re inquisitive and curious, often driven to learn by doing and through experimentation.
           They’re less likely to ask for help than other personality types, although their own unique outlook and methodology makes them a vital part of a team to offer alternative suggestions or routes through a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further aiding the team is another member who is an <b>Assertive Defender</b> (ISFJ-A).
            Defenders often have great people skills, strong communicators, and fine-tuned perception.
            They have a natural willingness to aid others and offer compassion, making them a critical part of the group, even if one whom is often least noticed despite their work-ethic is being incredible.
            This member being Assertive is also unique among the team, being Assertive allows them to keep a calmer head and remain in control of the situation, not losing heart or hope if things don’t go entirely to plan, becoming adaptable to an everchanging situation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Finally to bring everyone else together we have a member who is a <b>Protagonist</b> (ENFJ-A).
           The Protagonist by nature is a born leader who’s interest is greater than their own and often have long-term vision.
           Their goal to have an impact on those around, making them an ideal glue for the team which every other kind of personality can revolve around and if need be, interact through.
          </p>
          <p>
            All together combined, Group Eleven has a strong team whose natural strength is one of deep consideration and thought.
            Compassion and empathy flow through the group’s members, meaning there isn’t likely to be concern of ego or conflict, rather the team is likely to help each-other towards a larger collective goal.
          </p>
