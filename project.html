          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>This project aims to create an automated indoor plant-care
            system for everyday consumers, with a modern design that
            helps it to seamlessly blend in with the surrounding decor
            making it a feature of the home, rather than an eye-sore,
            and a multi-device capable user-friendly control system
            application that takes the guesswork out of plant-parenting.
          </p>
          <p>By utilising and expanding on existing irrigation systems
            and open-source plant-care software we can create a product
            that will become an essential part of indoor gardening and
            remove the worry of trying to find a plant-sitter or having
            to leave your plants unattended when you are away for extended
            periods of time.
          </p>

          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>Since the beginning of the Covid19 pandemic, sales of indoor
            plants have increased exponentially. While the trend of owning
            indoor plants was already on the rise, the extended isolation
            periods and work-from-home orders due to Covid19 has compelled
            many individuals to take up ‘plant parenting’ as a hobby, for
            relaxation and enjoyment, as well as purifying the air in their
            homes, and creating a way to stay connected with nature while
            unable to leave the house (Pflughoeft 2021). This booming trend,
            also known as ‘the Millennial plant revolution’ (George 2020)
            has seen rise of inexperienced but hopeful house-planters who
            are now becoming frustrated at the expense and time they are
            putting into their new plants only to have them wilt and die
            from overwatering or being scorched, and then trying multitudes
            of remedies to reverse the damage, creating a cycle of confusion,
            and not knowing what else to do (Sullivan 2021).
          </p>
          <p>Additionally, as the world begins to open back up, these new
            ‘plant-parents’, along with existing indoor plant enthusiasts,
            are going to find themselves faced with the challenge of keeping
            their plants alive when they are no longer home as often to care
            for them. Holidays, work trips, and long workdays can all contribute
            to the accidental neglect of house plants, with many forgetting to
            keep up with the watering, or returning home from a trip to dehydrated
            or dead plants. This leaves people needing to find a way to revive
            their plants or buy new plants each time they accidentally kill one.
          </p>
          <p>In order to prevent the untimely demise of house plants, we are
            creating an automated indoor plant-care system that will allow
            wireless monitoring and watering of potted plants, with both manual
            and automatic settings. It is to be designed in such a way that allows
            you to easily accommodate different sizes and types of plants without
            needing to be an expert gardener. This will be especially beneficial
            to those wanting to ensure their plants are cared for while they are
            away from home, but also serve as an everyday set-and-forget care system,
            giving you one less thing to worry about
          </p>
          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>There are a variety of existing automatic indoor irrigation
            systems on the market today, but there is always something
            lacking from them. Most current types will only function as
            a single station with one main water line, meaning that while
            it may have a split waterline that can be used for multiple plants,
            it all comes from one system and distributes the same amount of
            water to each plant at the same rate. The problem with this is
            the lack of accommodation for not only varying pot sizes, but
            varying water consumption requirements for individual plant types
            as well.
          </p>
          <p>For example, if you have a large fern in a 30cm pot, and a
            small begonia in a 12cm pot, they will both be supplied with
            the same amount of water, causing either one plant to be
            overwatered, or one to be underwatered. Similarly, a succulent
            and an African violet both in the same size pots will also
            have different watering level and frequency requirements
          </p>
          <p>To solve this problem, you need multiple valves in addition
            to multiple water lines that can be calibrated and operated
            individually by one main reservoir system. The task of getting
            water into the pots at individual rates is not the only challenge,
            as each pot may not always need the same amount of water dispersed
            each time. So, to fine tune the amount and rate of water dispersed
            you will need to monitor the moisture levels of the plants to
            determine the optimal time and amount needed for repeated watering.
            You will also need to consider the individual plants growing cycle,
            maturity, and the season or time of year. Additionally, if you are
            away from home, you will not have the ability to open or close blinds
            or move plants in and out of sun or shade, so with the inclusion of
            dimmable, colouring changing LED lighting over each pot station you
            can ensure your plants are getting an optimal amount of light to
            keep them healthy when blinds remained closed or simply over winter
          </p>
          <p>We can further reduce the steps required in the care process by
            producing custom pots with integrated moisture sensors, taking away
            the need for the user to insert a sensor into the plant soil themselves,
            never knowing if they have put it in the right spot, or potentially
            damaging the plant in the process. Additionally, each of these pots
            can be Wi-Fi enabled, allowing the main system to recognise which
            pot it is, and being able to transmit the monitoring data to the
            application for the user. If the user chooses to use the system
            with their own pot instead of one of our smart pots, they will
            still need to manually insert a moisture sensor with wireless
            connectivity, and a watering line will need to be placed in the
            soil directly. The individual pot designs can be based on one of
            the existing open-source self-watering pot systems, such as the
            one created by YouTuber ‘DIY Machines’ (2019), however these pots
            only hold a limited amount of water in their individual reservoir,
            and still require manual filling when it runs out. This type of
            smart pot system could be adapted to sit on a base at the main
            station which will refill the small reservoir from the main reservoir,
            allowing it the plant continue to self-water for extended periods
            of time.
          </p>
          <p>The control system application will allow you to create individual
            plant-specific watering and sunlight schedules while providing you
            with feedback on your plant’s condition through real-time monitoring.
            This means that users can monitor, set up and customise their plant’s
            care schedule from anywhere in the world via a smart phone or device
            with the aid of Raspberry Pi technology (Hallek 2020).
          </p>
          <p>Such applications already exist in various forms but are not as
            user-friendly as they could be. We would design an application that
            will make calculated suggestions on optimal watering times and amounts
            based on the monitored data. The base system itself will initially have
            the capacity to accommodate 5 pots. It will consist of a larger reservoir
            of 7 litres which can be used to refill the individual pot reservoir,
            or for plants in a traditional pot the refill line can use a manual
            insertion adapter to place the sensors and water line directly in the pot.
            The smart pots can be wirelessly paired to the system application and
            where the user can set the plant name and preferred moisture content or
            watering frequency. The system will then operate the individual water
            lines connected to the plants. Each of the 5 pot stations will have an
            LED light above them to provide light to all or individual plants,
            controlled again by the app with timer options.
          </p>
          <p>A feature of this system is the ability to continue using the automatic
            self-watering pots even when home with the plants. Once home, the user
            can place the pots around the house where they choose and instead of
            the base station refilling the pot, the app will instead alert the user
            to manually refill the pot’s smaller reservoir, meaning that plant
            positioning is not limited to the base.
          </p>
          <p>In general, all systems of automation have both advantages and
            disadvantages that need to be considered when deciding on which
            solution to use, and not all systems will be suitable for every
            property. Space, water access, power access and Wi-Fi connectivity
            will be required in order to make use of the system we are designing.
            However, if these requirements are met, the user will be able to go
            on holiday and travel care-free without needing to hire a house-sitter
            or worrying about how they will meet the needs of their beloved plants
            while they are gone.
          </p>
          <h2>Tools & Tech</h2>
          <p>The following list of tools and technologies are what we have determined
            will be required for this project. This is not an exhaustive list and may
            be subject to change as more details about the project are formed.

            <li>Raspberry Pi OS</li>
            <li>LED lighting</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <p>Additionally, we will require a casing/housing for the main watering station,
            as well as pots (these could be 3D printed to specification), hosting platform
            to run the app, a smart phone for testing the application and a willing indoor
            plant to test the watering system on.
          </p>

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>To build this specific project, you need to have some basic skills and knowledge
            in the Python programming language, application and UX design, electronic
            engineering, experience using Raspberry Pi, knowledge of irrigation systems,
            as well as some botanical or horticultural knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>Where skills in these areas are lacking, we can use research skills to obtain
            the knowledge we need, or failing that we can seek advice, mentoring, or
            outsource various aspects that are beyond the current abilities of our team.
          </p>
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>The result of the project should be a functioning automated watering system
            with the capability to be controlled wirelessly with both automatic scheduling
            and manual ‘on-demand’ watering and lighting capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>Ultimately the outcome is going to be having the reassurance to be able to leave
            indoor plants unattended for an extended period of time, knowing that their
            individual watering requirements are going to be automatically taken care of.
          </p>
          <p>The limitation of this system will be the size of the water reservoir and will
            determine the length of time that plants can be left unattended. The use of a
            reservoir is the initial choice over a plumed to faucet solution for easier set-up
            and manoeuvrability; however this could also be a future implementation.
