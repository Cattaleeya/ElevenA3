            <p> I am 43 years old from Sydney, NSW.
              I like to play jigsaw puzzles, listening to music, and learning to play
              guitar online.
            </p>
            <p> I have been interested in IT since I moved to work in Australia.
              During this time, I had to work closely with the Engineers Teams on the
              construction site in Karratha, Western Australia and two of my engineer
              colleagues showed me how to solve the IT problems/complication and showed
              me how to map the network drive. Besides, my former boss always upgraded
              his iPhone, iPad; however, he didn’t know how to connect to the company
              server so I would help him with that. And because of these scenarios my
              interest in the IT field was generated. Besides, I have always been curious
              about it on how it works, how they build the applications; and how coding
              is involved, etc. In addition, before I knew what I really want to do in the
              future, I also completed a bachelor’s degree of Arts, Advanced Diploma in
              Computing, Cer IV in Business Administration, Cer IV in Work Health and
              Safety and Cer II in Document Controller and Lead Auditor Certification for
              ISO 9001, ISO 14000 and OHSAS 18001. Therefore, do I have experiences in IT?,
              the answer is No for me and this is my first time to try the IT course and
              follow my dream.

            <p>I am a 36yo living in regional Victoria, AU, with 4 kids.
            </p>
            <p>I am a roller derby coach and skater for my local roller derby club.
              I enjoy reading, gardening, watching movies, and playing Roblox and
              Minecraft with my kids.
            </p>
            <p>I worked in retail for several years at an auto parts store, and a
              department store in the computers department. Then, while at home
              with my kids I started learning HTML, CSS, and PHP as a hobby so I
              could customise blogging platforms such as Blogspot and WordPress.
              That lead me to becoming interested in web design and online business.
              I worked as a freelancer and contractor setting up WordPress websites,
              content writing and managing online communities for couple years. Wanting
              to gain formal qualifications I began studying and completed a Cert 3 in
              E-business and completed some units on Internet Communications and Website
              Development. More recently I completed a Cert IV in Business, and then
              decided I wanted to study IT.

            <p>I've had an strong interest in IT since I was child, although only now seeking my investigation to the possibility to turning my love
              and passion into a potential career change away from retail. I’ve often been in the family and group of friends the ‘Computer Person’ to help others with
              their issues or troubleshooting, so it makes sense that maybe that’s something I could do on a grander scale and help people have a better
              time with computers. My prior learning before this was a Bachelor of Film, but I focused on editing which is computer-dependent.
              I strongly believe in the power of computers to enable a better society.

            <p>I am 18 years old from Sydney, NSW. I thoroughly enjoy gaming and streaming, along with playing rugby and going to the gym.

            </p>
            <p>My interest in IT comes from attending a UTS work experience course, within this course I was shown how critical IT security is,
              One of the teachers at UST showed us how he helps implement systems and firewalls to prevent hackers, along with increasing the
              company’s security he has gotten paid by major companies such as apple to try and hack through there security firewalls as steal critical information,
              he then goes and shows them how he did it so they can improve their security.

              Thus, by doing this course, I hope it will help me find a career in cyber security, I believe doing this course is a great way to get myself familiar
              with the necessary requirement that could be needed within the industry, I don’t have any professional experience, but I pick things up quickly.

            <p>40+, 2 x girls (22,16), I am Chilean, I live in Pakenham, Victoria. Play piano, in my spare time, I am doing my uni course ( either homework or study ) I am also studying to gain my CCNA certification
            </p>
            <p>I love IT as I like to know how things work, and I love the challenge that computers provide, you can have the such a variation of uses for them,
              and the specifications which is awesome. I am a movie buff so watching our the technology and movies progressed since the early 90’s has really attracted me
              to computers. Being the person “in the chair” or the technician you call for help. I achieved my Cert 4 in IT networking in 2010 and my Advanced Diploma in Computer Systems & Engineering and Security
              (Cyber/Networking) in 2015, I have been working at Officeworks for almost 10 year, I also teach basic/mid-level networking at Chisholm TAFE since 2015 (sessional), I also work at Geeks2U as an on-site /
              remote IT technician.

              Each of these jobs gives me separate skill sets, eg directly from the customers / business at Officeworks and Geeks2U purchasing the IT equipment / toys and needing to get them to work together, and new equipment coming out and then playing /
              using them to then having the students at TAFE and building on their gaps in knowledge. These jobs also give me the patience and user interaction to be able to help the customers / clients / student’s needs which are all different too.

            <p>I am 30 years old from Melbourne, Vic. In my spare time, I like to spend time with my partner Chloe and my two Dachshunds Maple and Hue.
              Aside from this, I spend a lot of my free time learning about different things on the internet and playing video games.
            </p>

            <p>I currently work for a chemical company as a field technician. I work with others in the company to develop methods of use for an array
              of dangerous chemicals with cyanide bases. This work would see me traveling both nationally and internationally conducting field studies
              to be used for chemical registration world wide. A milestone achievement for me is that I hold the record for the largest fumigation with
              Stabilized Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) within Australia to date – 38,600 Cubic metres.
            </p>

            <p>IT completely fascinates me. I love how computers work, the potential applications of computers, and how they can change people’s lives.
              I first became interested in computers when I was young playing a Super Nintendo. From there my school had some access to early computers and
              I grew up with the technology evolving around me – going from a 5 ¼ Inch floppy disc Macintosh, iMacs, Windows XP, now windows 10 and seeing
              DVDs be invented and then phased out. I have no IT experience, but I am keen to learn.
