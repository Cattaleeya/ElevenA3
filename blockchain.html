          <h2>Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies</h2>
             <center><img src="images/TheBlockchain.png" style="width:45%"></center>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin dominate the headlines, although the technology underpinning is not often given the same limelight.
            Yet to fully understand Cryptocurrency, you will first need to understand what is known as “The Blockchain”.  
            Despite its recent popularity, early versions of what would become known as Blockchain have been proposed and developed on for decades. 
            It began as a technology to ensure timestamps could not be tampered during record-keeping, in essence The Blockchain is a digital ledger.
            To ensure the upmost integrity of records, many blockchains are publicly available to be accessed, this is called a distributed ledger and the purpose is it makes it difficult to disrupt a past record without such an attempt being noticed.
            This is achieved by having many copies of the same ledger being shared across many systems and cross checks being performed as new data is added, this becomes decentralised instead of relying on one centralised database which could be vulnerable to infiltration or corruption.
            As more copies of the list are actively part of the system, its security increases as the ledger is checked and rechecked with each-other to provide the most structurally secured version of events. (Kulkarni, 2019) (Sheldon, 2021)
              <br>
            The name comes from each data point being referred to as a 'block'.
            A block contains three pieces of information, firstly is a unique identity code specific to that block (called as hash) and secondly it contained the hash of the previous block, this allows it to be placed correctly in the order of events, this is where the 'chain' from blockchain comes from, as each is strung together one after the other.
            Finally, the third piece of information is the actual data itself.
            The contents of this data depend on the purpose of the blockchain, for example in cryptocurrency it can be a transactional receipt of X sending coin to Y. (Little, 2019) 
            The linear fashion of a blockchain has many use cases for securing and verifying data, but it became uniquely suited for the invention of an all-digital decentralised currency. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrency as we know it today was proposed in 2008 under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, it is unknown if this refers to a single or group of people and much like Princess Anastasia, many have come forward claiming to be the true Nakamoto, although to this day the truth is yet to be revealed. (Bernard, 2018) 
            Cryptocurrency’s (or simply 'Crypto') are digital currencies which operate using Blockchain Technology on a mass scale, the blocks are used to represent coins and transactions, each coin is part of a whole, there’s often a total number of coins that are available within a coin which adds to its scarcity. (Nakamoto, 2008)
              <br>
            Crypto is designed as an alternative to traditional currency, where you have a digital wallet from which you can earn and spend your coin as would be common with traditional currency.
            The decentralised and largely unregulated nature of crypto has given rise to the question regarding the motives behind using it in terms of its usage for crime, either a direct transactional crime such as the sale of illicit drugs or financial crime in terms of money laundering.
            It could be seen as evidence that in 2014 when the. onion drug marketplace of The Silk Road being seized by American authorities, this causing a direct and notable dip sudden of Bitcoin's value by 24%, indicating the purpose at the time many had for using the coin. (Hern, 2013)
              <br>
            Although it is worth noting that the value quickly bounced back and as a rule, cryptocurrencies are extraordinarily volatile by nature.
            A prime example of this can be seen for when multibillionaire Elon Musk tweets something even passingly negative about Bitcoin, that alone causes an intense crash in value due to its inherently reactionary market. (Gandel, 2021)
              <br>
            Ironically in the case of coins like Bitcoin it is not as privacy-enabling as some might believe.
            Since the Blockchain is a publicly viewed ledger, it can also include traceable transactional history.
            In Australia as a requirement from the financial regulator AUSTRAC that companies in Australia who sell coins through exchange must keep their own records of which coins were sold to whom, so that in theory a coin could be potentially traced back through the blockchain to an individual who purchased them using conventional currency. (AUSTRAC, 2018)  
          </p>
          <p>
            The cost of maintaining a cryptocurrency solely would be immense as well as the security concerns that come along with it, so a vital part of the distributed ledger is the decentralised nature of which many-a cryptocurrency is based.
            Yet few would be willing to spend lots of traditional capital just for the charity of operating, so an incentive is required for the blockchain processing.
            This incentive for maintaining and operation the blockchain is a direct financial reward or payment in the form of the coin being number processed. For example, if you're participating in number crunching the blockchain for Bitcoin, your incentive is gaining Bitcoin as a reward for the work, this is known as 'mining', so when someone is Bitcoin Mining, it means that they've setup a device which is verifying data on the blockchain.
            This decentralised and incentive-based nature keeps transactional fees low, removes the need for international fees associated with traditional currency and keeps everything within a closed-loop. 
              <br>
            However, blockchains become larger with every single transaction, increasing the amount of data needed to be processed to perform a successful verification.
            This leads to the situation where only those with the most capital to spend on the blockchain have any real chance of mining. A richer gets richer scenario. (Bogna, 2021)
              <br>
            This is also where some concerns regarding cryptocurrency come into play.
            The more computing power that needs to be performed, then the higher amount of energy that is required to crunch the numbers.
            This has led to widespread criticism for environmental concerns and power-management concerns, especially in 2021 where many nations struggled to provide power.
            The environmental concern extends into the issue of E-Waste, since the mining setups are running at maximum processing continuously, it means that hardware is being burnt out at exorbitant rates, adding pile of waste onto an already troubling situation.
            There are other less severe side-effects on the traditional marketplace as well, such as the prices of computer components rising dramatically because of the demand of miners, impacting everyone else. (Aratani, 2021) 
              <br>
            This combined with the ongoing silicon shortage and the renewed demand for working/learning from home due to the pandemic as led to a uniquely demanding situation for many consumers, especially those who might financially struggle to acquire hardware. (Chin, 2020) (Bandoim, 2018)

            Of recent Cryptocurrency has been embraced increasingly by the investor world, viewing it as a modern version of gold.
            Historically Gold has been used to hold wealth in something outside of traditional currency, the theory being that if the value of cash fell in an event such as recession, that this is an independent value to that of gold.
            Therefore, art has often been used as an alternative investment for the wealthy (or a vessel for money laundering).
            The digital version of this is directly related to cryptocurrency, in a form known as Non-Fungible Tokens (or simply ‘NFT’).
            NFTs take the foundation of Crypto but transform it from the block being used to represent coin, to instead represent ownership, so the block becomes a deed.
            When something such as art is being sold in the form of NFT, the data being held on the blockchain itself is not the art in question (such as a .jpg), but rather it’s a deed indicating ownership of the art.
            This has directly risen concerns that NFTs much like Crypto is being used for purposes such as money laundering but in a far more hidden way as the value of art is subjective. Who isn't to say that a selfie isn't worth $250,000,000 AUD?

            Who isn't to say that a selfie isn't worth $250,000,000 AUD? (Purtill 2021) (Encila, 2021)

            <br>

            There are many unanswered questions regarding the future of cryptocurrency as it's a quickly developing area of both interest and scrutiny.
            With over four-thousand coins currently developed, it is easy to assume that most will end up failing as without any value many blockchains are likely to simply cease operation, if there's nobody interested in maintaining the blockchain then the foundation of that coin will cease along with it.
            Larger players in the market are likely to continue operation but the future will ultimately rely on how much value the coins will end up having in the end, or to put it another way, if something can really be used with Crypto outside of speculative investment.  (Wanguba, 2021) 
               <br>            
            There will be a lot of attention paid to El Salvador, whom in 2021 became the first nation to approve a cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) as legal tender which can be used to pay taxes with.
            There is an inherent gamble with taking on such a decentralised currency, one which could easily disrupt the national currency.
            While thanks to the blockchain it’s almost impossible to directly manipulate a coin from its code, it is however extremely easy to manipulate the market, often through pump-and-dump schemes which inflate and crash the value of coins, tying this volatility into a national currency could have a profound impact on everyday life. (Zagorsky, 2021) Although if successful, it could inspire other nations to follow-on and also include Crypto as legal tender. (Hall, 2022)
            The idea of multiple nations sharing the same currency can be seen in Europe by sharing the Euro, this has shown that when the times are good it can elevate weaker economies but when times a rough it can drag larger ones down. The Euro also realistically relies on larger economies like France and Germany picking up the slack to make it work, yet no such grace will be found in the Crypto world and with its unregulated nature, it's not hard to imagine that certain bad actors could easily manipulate the market and attempt to crash real economies.
            The stakes have been raised, instead of being pretend internet play money as is often portrayed by the media, the more businesses which accept Crypto as part of their model could either form the foundation of a new economic revolution or cause a knock-on effect which would bring ruin to many. 
              <br>
            Crypto brings along romantic images of crypto-anarchism and a desire to move away from relying on governments. It is then ironic that a keyway for Crypto to gain increasing legitimacy will be through regulation and control, which fundamentally opposes the original evangelical desires of many cryptocurrencies to be sperate from the traditional system of governance. To which the question would have to be then asked, what's the point? (Jose, 2021) 
            Blockchain Technology could have a positive impact moving forward, separated from Crypto the Blockchain is versatile enough to be used in many applications from traditional banking, education and STEM. (Forbes, 2020) Concerns about the environmental impact already are slowly being addressed by emerging blockchains becoming more efficient and the idealistic vision of energy to be drawn from renewables. (Schmidt, 2021) 
          </p>
            <br>
          <p>
            The price of computer components is a direct effect which has been felt, even when not participating in Cryptocurrency thanks to the increase of mining.
            Otherwise, it currently stands in Australia, where Crypto is not considered legal tender.
            How much impact Crypto has is as much as you're willing to put into it. If you invest large sums of your personal capital into Crypto, then you're directly affected by the highs & lows of the market.
            Although if you're not investing any amount in Crypto then it has little to no impact on your life whatsoever. Unlike traditional global currencies where the impact can have knock-on effects which can determine how much your dollar is valued, inflation or even job-loss via recession, as it currently stands in Australia, Crypto has no serious impact on any of it.
            If you're not engaged, it has little to no impact on you. With everything taken into consideration, it is likely for the best that Crypto remain a curiosity rather than a part of everyday life. The pandemic shown that the internet gap has profound impacts, for those who are disadvantaged or simply live in the 'wrong' area, access to the internet for working or education was difficult or impossible. (Duffy, 2020)
            People in these scenarios would only be further left behind if a move to a Crypto future was embraced. Indeed, a separate but relevant discussion can be found of the use of hard cash verses digital payments. Many of us already use tap-payments in everyday for our convenience, this might not be that dissimilar to a proposed everyday payment method as Crypto.
            But for those who rely on hard cash if they're too young to have a debit card or that they're simply not engaged with the modern world for whatever personal reason, Crypto can widen the wealth gap, not close it. (Chau, 2021) 
            <br>        
            Maybe we’ve become so interested in the question of if we can create a decentralised all-digital currency, we never stopped to ask, if we should?
