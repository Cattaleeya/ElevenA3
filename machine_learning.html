          <p><strong>What does it do? </strong><br>
            Machine learning (ML) is a method of data analysis that
            collects a large amount of data using an algorithm to predict
            and refine outcomes that usually involve interaction with
            end-users (Davenport n.d.). It is also a branch of artificial
            intelligence (AI) based on the idea that systems can learn from
            data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human
            intervention. Machine learning teaches computers to think in a
            similar way to how humans do (IBM Cloud Education 2020).
          </p>

          <!-- </div>-->


            <p>Machines follow instructions given by humans who train them
              to do things like actual humans do and unsurprisingly, to learn; 
              therefore, this is the reason why we called them ‘machine learning’.
              It learns from the data which has been built to predict the model 
              accurately. Therefore, when the new data point comes in, it can 
              easily predict. It has been proven that the more data input, the 
              more accurate it will be (Davenport n.d.). 
            </p><p style="height:5%;"></p>


          <!--</div>-->
      <div class="section">
        <p>Machine Learning (ML) can be described into three types of models, 
          according to Brooks & Dahlke (2017), as followed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>	<em>Supervised Learning</em> – where the data was labelled and
            used as a training set to teach the machine until the precise results 
            have been accepted. Teaching a machine to recognise breeds of dogs using
            pictures could be an example of whether they could identify and acknowledge
            the various species of dogs from other animals or not. The advantage of this
            approach is better system control and accuracy; however, this approach could
            be laborious, considering how much time you need to put in with labelling. </li>
          <li>	<em>Unsupervised Learning</em> – where the data was unlabelled and the 
            model is never trained upon the given dataset, which means it does not have 
            any idea about features of the dataset; therefore, it needs to identify the 
            images feature on their own. However, even though it is good that no humans
            are involved in the process, it could easily make errors because of the lack 
            of human interaction with the machine. </li>
          <li>	<em>Reinforcement Learning</em> – this approach is different from the other
            models as it learns and improves from its feedback as well as experiences. Thus,
            it will balance itself by what they did good or not and what should be done to 
            improve themselves. However, data inputs will be required to ensure that the
            machine will receive the proper feedback. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
          
      <p>
        Machine learning has been used everywhere. For instance, using machine learning for 
        diagnostics in healthcare to assist doctors to predict and review patient cases 
        (Kovalenko & Chuprina n.d.), using machine learning on social media to detect spam or 
        fraud (Board Infinity 2019), using machine learning in finance/banking sector, Netflix
        to predict what kind of movies/series you like based on your previous review, Google, 
        Voice Command or recognition (Sponsor News 2021), Face recognition (PXL Vision 2021), 
        Robot vacuums, driverless car, ATM, uber to predict where is the most customer nearby 
        so it can be available in that area (Robinson 2019), which have been involved in everyone 
        daily at the present day. 
      </p>

      </div>
      
      <p class="section">
        Additionally, when we are talking about the state of the art in Machine Learning, then
        Deep Learning Model features give the machine an intelligent feature that can recognize 
        objects. This intelligence has now been involved in everyone daily life for all ages 
        (MathWorks n.d.). These are just a few examples where machine learning is making more impact
        along with Artificial Intelligence with everyone life. Indeed, it’s a brilliant future 
        technology development to make life easier for anyone.
      </p>
      
      <p class="section">
        Based on Garbade (2018), there are several open sources of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
        technologies that make machine learning possible to the next level:
        <ul>
          <li> TensorFlow initially released in 2015, created by Google and is available in Python, 
            C++, Haskell, Java, Go, Rust, and most recently JavaScript.</li>
          <li> Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, initially released in 2016 (previously referred to as 
            CNTK), is an artificial intelligence (AI) solution to take machine learning to the next level.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p class="section">
        Moreover, Dixon (2016) has pointed out that these possible future technologies can be developed for example:
        <ul>
          <li> Self-Driving Cars</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
       <div class="align-center">
        <img style= "width:400px;" src="images/ml_img3.png" alt="graphic of what driverless cars might look like">
        <p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 3: </strong><em>What a city with driverless cars might look like</em> by Dixon, 2016 </p>
      </div>
       
      <p class="section">
        Figure 3 shows how self-driving cars can be improved in the next 3 - 5 years which will help users 
        to be safer on the road and will begin to go mainstream. Cars will communicate with one another to 
        avoid accidents and traffic jams, and riders will be able to spend commuting time on other activities
        like work, education, and socialising (Dixon 2016).
      </p>
  
    <ul class="section"><li>Clean energy</li></ul>

    <p class="section">
      Clean Energy – for example, Tesla is making high performance, affordable electric vehicles, and installing
      electric charging stations worldwide. In Japan, there are now more electric charging stations than gas 
      stations which allow the price of electric cars more affordable, and it should be considered worldwide at
      a reasonable price, so it is affordable for everyone, according to Dixon (2016).<br>
      Therefore, machine learning is not going away anytime soon. Looking into the future, it will become more 
      clearly involved in the next level of technologies at all levels by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer science. 
    </p>

    <h4>What is the likely impact? </h4>
    <p>
      Machine learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial intelligence (AI) which is based on algorithms that improve 
      automatically through experience. Various industries ranging from IT, finance, media, gaming, robotics, and 
      manufacturing have already set machine learning technology practice. Furthermore, machine learning is used 
      in a variety of fields, including health, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision.</p>
      
      <p>Machine learning’s algorithm assists manufacturers in understanding how their goods are being used so that
      they can modify them according to customer preferences. Netflix has implemented machine learning algorithms 
      to correlate your choices with those of people with similar likes to propose what you would be most interested 
      in viewing next (Netflix Research n.d.). This has a potential impact on the company as the customer may find more
      movies and series they enjoy, meaning that they would keep paying for the monthly subscription.</p>
      
      <p>Another potential impact for machine learning is in the automotive industry, which is excelling by making 
      self-driving a reality, with the use of voice recognition, IoT and high-tech camera in combination with ml, 
      according to ERTICO (2020), is expected to make the self-driving cars a reality. Therefore, this would affect 
      every driver since all you have to do is tell the car where you want to go, and it would figure out the shortest
      route and safely drive you there.</p>
      
      <p>In the future machine learning will help build self-learning robots and machines which are expected to improve 
      their performance without using any human involvement. In this way, the machines can make decisions based on data 
      by using the data from the past to predict future actions. This means that people may lose their jobs as there can 
      be robots that will be able to perform given tasks with more efficiency. For instance, some of these jobs would be
      taxi drivers, store cashiers, travel agents. Thus, people that live in this area would not have any means of making money or a living.
    </p>

    <h4>How will this affect you? </h4>
    <p>
      Whether we realize it or not, machine learning affects almost everyone. It influences what we see while on Facebook,
      Instagram, and Twitter by using data to recommend or suggest other or similar products, videos, and films that you may 
      enjoy. This is affecting our everyday life since we frequently find ourselves browsing through Netflix looking for a 
      new show when we can simply go to the suggested section and see all the movies that the algorithm thinks we would love,
      which has helped us discover a variety of new and interesting shows.</p>
      
      <p>Machine learning would be most beneficial in the field of education as Jesus et al. (2020) found out that machine learning
      capabilities are being used to analyse kids' academic comprehension, investigate how he/she acquires knowledge, and develop
      a customised academic plan that can aid in focusing on that specific student's healthy attribute. Machine learning, in 
      addition to teaching, is assisting educational institutions in developing an organised method of managing students and workers
      through automatic responses, customised software, and other ways. The algorithms analyse test results and give a one-of-a-kind
      grading system, which may save teachers' time while also assisting in the development of instructional modules for students. 
      Not to mention that machine learning may be quite useful for kids who are struggling or have learning gaps.</p>
      
      <p>With machine learning advancing at an exponential rate, the likelihood of driverless cars is almost certain. Therefore, this 
      will be extremely beneficial for some members of our family, for example, our dad who has to drive into the city every day for
      work, our mom who has to buy groceries and our brothers/sisters who have to drive to university. The use of a driverless car
      would reduce the possibility of a car accident, making it a safer option to use along with the car system being able to
      automatically find the fastest route. However, there are both positive and negative aspects of an automated system, as there 
      are potential risks that can occur, but an argument can be made that artificial intelligence (AI) is just doing what it is 
      programmed for. Thus, if the necessary code is implemented, risk factors will change dramatically.
