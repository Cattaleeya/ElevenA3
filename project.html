          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <h3>Topic</h3>
            <p>Since the beginning of the Covid19 pandemic, sales of indoor plants
              have increased exponentially. While the trend of owning indoor plants
              was already on the rise, the extended isolation periods, and work-from-home
              orders due to Covid19 has compelled many individuals to take up
              ‘plant parenting’ as a hobby, for relaxation and enjoyment, as well
              as purifying the air in their homes, and creating a way to stay
              connected with nature while unable to leave the house (Pflughoeft 2021).
              This booming trend, also known as ‘the Millennial plant revolution’
              (George 2020)  has seen the rise of inexperienced but hopeful house-planters
              who are now becoming frustrated at the expense and time they are putting
              into their new plants only to have them wilt and die from overwatering or
              being scorched, and then trying multitudes of remedies in order to reverse
              the damage, creating a cycle of confusion, and not knowing what else to
              do (Sullivan 2021).
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, as the world begins to open back up, these new
              ‘plant-parents’, along with existing indoor plant enthusiasts,
              are going to find themselves faced with the challenge of keeping
              their plants alive when they are no longer home as often to care
              for them. Holidays, work trips, and long workdays can all contribute
              to the accidental neglect of house plants, with many forgetting to
              keep up with the watering, or returning home from a trip to dehydrated
              or dead plants. This leaves people needing to find a way to revive
              their plants or buy new plants each time they accidentally kill one.
            </p>
              To prevent the untimely demise of house plants, we are creating an
              automated indoor plant-care system that will allow wireless monitoring
              and watering of potted plants, with both manual and automatic settings.
              It is to be designed in such a way that allows you to easily accommodate
              different sizes and types of plants without needing to be an expert gardener.
              This will be especially beneficial to those wanting to ensure their plants
              are cared for while they are away from home, but also serve as an everyday
              set-and-forget care system, giving you one less thing to worry about.
              </p>
            <p>By utilising and expanding on existing irrigation systems
              and open-source plant-care software we can create a product
              that will become an essential part of indoor gardening and
              remove the worry of trying to find a plant-sitter or having
              to leave your plants unattended when you are away for extended
              periods of time.
            </p>

          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>An age-old problem with a modern solution. Plant death at the hands
            of neglectful or over-eager plant lovers is not a new concern, but the
            recent resurgence of pandemic-induced indoor gardening has brought
            the issue to the forefront. As people return to their busy lives,
            they are realising they can no longer be as attentive to their green
            life as they once had. This is where modern technology can help.
            The use of IoT (Internet of Things) devices in the home are increasing
            as consumers are realising the benefit of automated assistance.
            We believe our product, while it may seem like a novelty at first,
            could become a regular addition to households of today, and the future.
          </p>
          <h3>Landscape</h3>
          <p>There are several indoor automated watering systems and plant care
            apps on the market today, but none combine all the aspects that the
            user ideally wants in an all-in-one system. At present, automated indoor
            irrigation systems consist of a control box with one or two watering
            lines that may be split among multiple plants. 
          </p>
          <p>The problem with these types of systems is that all plants (or
            groups of plants) must be watered at the same intervals with the
            same amounts of water. Additionally, while some systems on the
            market now come with an app to control them, if you require more
            than two watering schedules you are required to purchase and pair
            additional irrigation units, which can become expensive if you have
            a variety of plants with different needs. 
          </p>
          <p>Another issue with this method of multiple drip irrigation is that
            they lack moisture sensors, and water level sensors, so not only
            will the pump continue once the water is gone, but you may
            accidentally overwater your plant, making it susceptible to root
            rot and fungus gnats. These systems also require some assembly by
            the user, such as measuring and cutting the lengths of tubing,
            attaching t-connectors and water filters, as well as needing to
            provide their own water reservoir.
          </p>
          <p>With our system, a user can pot their plant directly into our
            smart pot, fill the built-in water reservoir, and then control how
            much and how often their plant will get water, depending on the
            plant’s individual needs. The user will also be able to keep their
            plants in any position around the home, instead of needing to group
            them all together in one place. </p>

          <h2>Project Details</h2>
          <p>The aim of this project is to create an indoor multi-plant
            irrigation system that can be easily monitored and controlled
            from a smart device, allowing users to care for their plants with
            differing needs while away from home.
          </p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <h4>01. Refine Project Plan</h4>
            <p>For this goal we need to review our original project idea and
              refine it into a manageable project that fits within the scope of
              our collective abilities and timeframes. We have additional features
              for our project that do not need to be in the first prototype of the
              project, and by allocating these to future improvements and
              modifications we can focus on the central functionality of the project.
            </p>
            <h4>02. Market Research</h4>
            <p>Analyse what products are currently on the market, and what makes
              ours viable. By looking at the existing market we can identify what
              our competitors are doing well and where they are lacking. This will
              help us establish what features will make our product stand out from
              others, and why it is special.
            </p>
            <h4>03. Research Components, Tools & Materials</h4>
            <p>This goal is to produce a list of any components, tools, software,
              or materials needed to build our project, including pricing and source contact details.
            </p>
            <h4>04. Drafts and Wireframes</h4>
            <p>This goal is to produce the wireframes, and drafts of the pot, app,
              and presentation. Sketching out representations of how we aim for the
              product to look will give us a quick visual guide and allow us to
              review and make changes to the basic designs before moving onto
              producing full colour mock-ups and models. The wireframes of the
              app should cover the functionality that has been identified in the
              programming design plan
            </p>
            <h4>05. Programming Design/Plan</h4>
            <p>For this goal we need to define the minimum functional requirements
              of our app and develop a programming plan that would make it clear
              to a programmer what our requirements are.
            </p>
            <h4>06. 3D Model of Pot</h4>
            <p>This goal is to use software to produce a 3D model of the pot and
              its individual components to ensure all of the required parts will
              fit together and allow us to provide 3D files of the pot for 3D
              printing of the prototype.
            </p>
            <h4>07. Mock-Up of App</h4>
            <p>For this goal we need to produce a coloured mock-up version of
              basic aspects of the app to show us what the final version of the app would look like
            </p>
            <h4>08. Draft & Produce Video Presentation</h4>
            <p>This goal is to write a draft script and story board of the video
              presentation, and then to produce a video presentation for our project
              based on our draft.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Plans & Progress</h2>
          <p>In the beginning, our project started as an app-controlled
            multi-plant main station irrigation system that required the
            pot plants to be placed at/on or near the main station in order
            for a moisture sensor and drip line to be manually inserted into
            the pot. The main station would have a large reservoir in order
            to deliver water to each of the pots, at a rate that was unique
            to the needs of the individual plants in each pot, as opposed to
            delivering the same amount of water to all pots at the same time.
            The limitations of this were needing to decide on a set number of
            pots that could be accommodated, and how close the pots would need
            to be.
          </p>
          <p>We then had the idea of adding an optional SmartPot that could
            water itself from a built-in reservoir while still sending data
            to the main station and allowing it to be controlled by the app,
            along with the individual plants at the main station. This would
            allow a plant to remain in its original position around the home,
            while its built-in waterlines and sensors mean that the user does
            not need to worry about inserting sensors, potentially damaging
            the roots of their plants, or not placing it deep enough to get
            an accurate reading. The user would just need to make sure the
            pot was charged before leaving and fill the pot’s water reservoir.
            Additional features considered for the project included light
            sensors and overhead lighting attached to the main station and
            pots so that plants could still receive adequate light if a user
            had their blinds closed while they were away for extended periods.
            We also considered having the smart pots placed on a base at the
            main station, having the main station fill the pot reservoirs, and
            the possibility of the base being a wireless charging pad for the pots.
          </p>
          <p>After some deliberation, we decided that for our given timeframe,
            the best option for now would be to bypass the main station and work
            on producing the pot and app, which can do exactly what we were aiming for.
          </p>
          <div class="section">
            <h4>The Pot</h4>
            <p>While both components of our project had us thinking of many
              potential features, we again looked at what we could realistically
              achieve and started planning for what the essential functions of
              both the pot and the app would need to be. We first started with a
              discussion, and sketches of what the pot design may look like, and
              then produced a diagram of what the functions and features of the pot
              needed to be (See Appendix A).
            </p>
            <p>We agreed that for a user to want this in their home, it would
              need to have a minimal and modern style, and not look too different
              from an ordinary pot so that it would be suitable to match with almost
              any interior decor. For this, we decided that a sleek white pot with
              a woodgrain style base would be best. We also discussed the
              possibility of designing ‘sleeves’ that a user could purchase
              separately to update the colour or pattern of their pot, without
              needing to buy a new pot and repotting the plant.
            </p>
            <h4>Pot Components & Design</h4>
            <p>The base section of the pot encases the batteries, Raspberry Pi
              and other electronic components in a water-tight recess that is
              accessed by a screw cap. The pump, water level sensor and tubing
              are housed by the inner wall cavity space that forms the 1.5L
              volume water reservoir. The moisture level sensor is inserted through
              the base of the inner pot wall, providing an optimal monitoring
              position at the base of the pot, and up into the plant roots.
            </p>
            <p>The reservoir is filled by removing the top rim of the pot, allowing
              filling from any side. Water is distributed through two lengths of
              tubing that emerge at the top ring of the pot, on opposite sides,
              enabling water to be dispersed evenly and directly to the plant soil.
            </p>
            <p>The pot is equipped with a USB charging port, and multi-colour LED
              power button, which indicates the status of the pot. (See Appendix
              B for detailed components diagram)
            </p>
            <h4>The App</h4>
            <p>When discussing the development of the app we had many ideas for
              features, some were not realistically within our scope, and some
              were possible future additions, including:
              <ul>
                <li>adding a social element to it via public user ‘greenhouses’
                  and the ability to follow other app users plant collections,
                  or save plants they like to favourites list
                </li>
                <li>a database of plants that a user can use to identify their
                  plant and receive a recommended watering schedule
                </li>
                <li>the ability to identify plant issues via a Plant Doctor
                  feature which would tell the user what might be wrong with
                  their plant, and how they can remedy it
                </li>
                <li>the integration of ads and business profiles that allowed
                  users to shop for their plants
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>When designing the app we started with a diagram plan of what features
              and functions it should have, and a Minimum Viable Product outline, for
              both App and Pot, to establish what the minimum requirements would be
              (See Appendix E). We then produced a roughly sketched wireframe design
              for a couple of ‘screens’ for the app, to see what it may look like
              and to explain ideas for functions. Both plans were created using a
              free InVision account.
            </p>
            <p>Using Canva Pro we produced the logo, and the first 12 screens of a
              coloured mock-up idea, showing the main functions of the app, such
              as the login and sign-up screen, how to add a plant and how to connect a pot.
            </p>
            <p>See the  Appendix for product logo and user profile page mockup (Appendix F),
              and the full 12 mockup screens (Appendix G)
            </p>
            <h4>Market Research</h4>
            <p>When conducting market research we found that existing products
              either have a good app with or without a wireless moisture sensor
              component and no physical watering capabilities; an app but only
              controlling a unit that waters one or more plants but only at the
              same time and volume with no customisation, or they are a stand-alone
              irrigation unit also with scheduling set directly on the unit but
              also with only one (or in some cases two) pumps to accommodate only
              one or two watering schedules. Our product stands out here, by
              allowing customised monitoring and watering schedules for each pot
              that is paired.
            </p>
            <p>Pricing on these units ranged from around $50 to $200.

          <h3>Sam - IT Business Support Analyst</h3>
          <p>As an IT Business Support Analyst my role was to conduct research
            into various hardware and software components of the business as
            well as any needs the business may require in the future. I conducted
            risk analysis’, outlined the testing program and created channels
            by which the company can fulfill future skills shortages by way of
            job postings. I conducted research into hard parts and costings and
            developed a parts cost poster, see appendix. Another important aspect
            of my role was to participate in group discussions from an analysts’
            point of view. I made sure to consider design guidelines and core
            concepts when providing suggestions while working with the design
            team towards success.

          <h2>Scope</h2>
          <p>The Eleven is aware of the challenges within the project begin
            undertaken. When considering the scope of the project the team considered:
            <ul>
              <li>Timeframe to complete each section: design, fabrication,
                testing, marketing and market research, videography, and review.
              </li>
              <li>Product creation and feasibility
              </li>
              <li>Given roles and the team's strengths and weaknesses
              </li>
              <li>Skills shortages and gaps that would hinder production or the success of the project.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The initial plan was to create an automated pot plant system by
            which you would be able to see key details regarding the plants
            inside each pot within a personal network (your home) and then
            enable a watering feature to maintain the optimum moisture in the
            soil for plant growth and fruiting. This system initially was designed
            to be a ‘main station’ where smart pots would be connected to and
            the water reservoir would be filled up and batteries would be charged,
            and other information exchanged. To summarize the group would have to create:
            <ul>
              <li>The main station/plantdock</li>
              <li>Individual smart pots</li>
              <li>WaterMePlz App</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The group decided that this project was too large considering the
            before mentioned challenges and constraints and after discussions
            held in the early weeks of the project, it was decided the scope of
            the project would change. The scope of the project is now:
            <ul>
              <li>Create 3d images/designs of the Smart pot</li>
              <li>Create the WaterMePlz app design and functionality through both
                wireframing and visual design publications</li>
              <li>Create advertisement materials for the promotion of the project and product</li>
              <li>Convert the website to have a marketing focus to promote the product</li>
              <li>Complete market research into parts, all, if any competition and
                establish excepted position in the current market (Globally)</li>
              <li>Develop the WaterMePlz application inclusive of all testing
                associated with the development process</li>
              <li>Fabricate the Smart Pot prototype and conduct testing </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The team has decided this scope will be completable in the given
            timeframe and has been added into the project plan and timeline
            provided in the report. Please refer for details.</p>

          <h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
          <p>The following list of tools and technologies are what we have
            determined will be required for this project. This is not an
            exhaustive list and may be subject to change as more details
            about the project are formed.
            <ul>
              <li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
              <li>Electronic breadboard</li>
              <li>Solenoid valves and relays</li>
              <li>Moisture sensor</li>

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>We will also require a casing/housing for the pots (3D printed
            to specification), a hosting platform to run the app, a smartphone
            for testing the application and a willing indoor plant to test the
            watering system on.
          </p>
          <p>Additionally, for our presentation video we will require use of the following:</p>
          <p><strong>Premiere Pro</strong> (version 22.2) developed by Adobe,
            included in the Creative Cloud licence.
          </p>
          <p>This is video editing software used by Mark who has edited various
            short films and previously achieved a Bachelor of Film. The purpose
            of this tool is in the creation of the mock commercial for the product,
            along with the Assignment 5 video pitch.
          </p>
          <h2>Testing</h2>
          <p>The project has multiple sections which will all need testing.
            The testing types will be both practicable and theory based.
            Described below are the sections and the type of testing we will be conducting.
          </p>
          <h4>1. App Development</h4>
          <h4>2. Smart Pot Development</h4>
          <p></p>
          <h3>App Development</h3>
          <p>App development will require both theory and practicable testing programs.
          </p>
          <h4>App development theory test:</h4>
          <p>This will entail the design of the app and its functions.
            The app is to be tested internally with team to determine the
            correct flow and design of the app with user experience and
            functionality as priority.
          </p>
          <h4>App development Practical test:</h4>
          <p>This will entail the actual programming and execution of the app
            at runtime. The app is to be tested to ensure all errors in the code
            are handled and that the app ‘works’. This will be conducted in the
            later stages of the project development.
          </p>
          <h3>Smart Pot Development</h3>
          <p>The Smart Pot development will require several stages of testing like the app development. </p>
          <h4>Design theory testing:</h4>
          <p>This will require the team to assess the design of the smart pots
            and make decisions based on practicality, feasibility, and market
            competitiveness. The team will assess each function and component
            of the design, discussion the priority of the feature establishing
            which functions are core to the projects ideology and success then
            adding on functions until the criteria is met.
          </p>
          <h4>Smart Pot Design evaluation:</h4>
          <p>This will require the team to assess the look of the product to
            ensure the design guidelines have been followed and that the ideology
            remains intact. The group will assess the design and discuss any
            changes to be made based on referencing the project design guidelines.
          </p>
          <h4>Smart Pot practical test:</h4>
          <p>This will require the smart pot to be active and running both with
            the app and without the app finished. The purpose of this test is
            to make sure the pot is fully reactive with the sensors and functions
            as per the design guidelines. Electrical circuits, water flow systems
            and the sizing will be evaluated and changes are to be made based on
            findings from the test. A discussion will be held by which the team
            will be able to talk about the smart pot and add any concerns or
            solutions to the testing activity before passing the testing stage.

          <h2>Risks</h2>
          <h3>Hardware assembly parts becoming discontinued from supplier</h3>
          <p>Currently the parts required to create the Smart Pot are all readily available.
            There are some parts that are more at risk of discontinuation or being outdated.
            These parts include:
            <ul>
              <li>Raspberry Pi Zero</li>
              <li>Rechargeable battery packs</li>
            </ul>
          The solution to the Raspberry Pi risk is the purchase adequate stock and
          then adapt design to suit updated model
          The solution to the battery pack is the buy adequate stock and then
          invest in alternate options for batteries that will suit the design.
        </p>

        <h3>App development functionality not achievable </h3>
        <p>A risk to developing apps are the design ideas themselves and the way
          they interact with the creation process. This is a huge risk to the
          project where if core functionality is too difficult, or unobtainable
          to begin with, then the project cannot be completed according to the
          design guidelines and project ideology. Therefore, it is important to
          research and confirm the ability to create the functionality within
          the app and the hardware to suit. An example of this would be:
          <ul>
            <li>The app will be able to identify what plant you have by the look of the plant </li>
          </ul>
        While this example might sound amazing, simplistic and ‘easy to execute’,
        in reality, is quite difficult to actualize making this simple idea a risk to the project success.
      </p>

      <h3>App Security – Data base breaches, Usernames, locations</h3>
      <p>Data security is an ongoing risk that will need to be managed throughout
        the whole project. Specifically, the risk of a data breach. The app will
        collect private personal information about people and it is important that
        the information is protected. Information that might be sourced through
        data breaches would include:
        <ul>
          <li>Usernames and passwords</li>
          <li>Account information with personal information</li>
          <li>Access to application and usage data</li>
          <li>Payment information</li>
          <li>Location services information</li>
        </ul>
        To protect the App against these types of breaches we will use well
        designed security protocols and programs in line with industry standards.
        </p>

        <h2>Group Processes & Communication</h2>
        <p>Our team maintains communication through weekly team meetings, group
          chat, and document collaboration via MS Teams, Microsoft Office and InVision.
        In the beginning, our team held weekly video calls to discuss project progress,
        but we adapted our communication schedule to include an additional informal
        meeting near the end of the week to provide further discussion, clarification,
        and updates on how tasks were progressing, allowing any issues to be resolved
        before the next official project meeting.
        Attendance at informal end of week meetings was not compulsory, but all team
        members were encouraged to attend if they were able. Team members who were
        working on tasks that involved one or two others were also able to schedule
        their own additional task-specific meetings.
        When collaborating on documents in Microsoft Office and InVision,
        team members communicated using positioned comments that highlighted
        the area for discussion. The comments were used to provide feedback,
        make suggestions, and ask for clarification on different aspects of
        the writing or diagrams in use. This allowed us to work together on
        the same item without needing to be in a call with one another.
