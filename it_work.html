          of his responsibilities. 
          </p>

          <h3>
            Question 2: Please tell us about the industry you work in. 
          </h3>
          <p>
            Cleve describes John Holland form an IT perspective. He talks about the nature of the work 
            that’s completed and give project examples such as: 
            <ul>
              <li>Hospital construction </li>
              <li>airport construction </li>
              <li>commercial development </li>
              <li>education institution construction </li>

              <li>wastewater networks and systems construction </li>
             </ul>
             Cleve describes the projects as challenging opportunities to adapt IT solutions to the project 
             teams. “So, lots of different areas of construction and lots of large projects” he concluded. 
          </p>
      
          <h3>
            Question 3: What other kinds of work do you have to do in the job? 
          </h3>
          <p>
            Cleve talks about general duties and goes on to talk about the Covid-19 pandemic and how it 
            changed the way projects were carried out. He lists circumstances such as: 
            <ul>
              <li>People working remotely </li>
              <li>Adapting systems to project specifications with Covid-19 restrictions </li>
              <li>Lockdowns </li>
              <li>Local government Area (LGA) restrictions </li>
            </ul>
            Cleve stated,” We very quickly had to adapt to the lockdowns”. He explains that these 
              circumstances and concerns changed the way projects were managed and that IT solutions needed 
              to support the company by creating adaptive systems to allow project managers to track: 
            <ul>
              <li>Ever-changing restrictions by locations  </li>
              <li>Manage labour and logistics  </li>
              <li>Use information systems to communicate within the company structure  </li>
              <li>Develop adaptive custom reports  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>
            Question 4: Who are the different people you interact with at work? 
          </h3>
          <p>
            When asked, Cleve began to list classes of stakeholders he as a project systems manager:  
            <ul>
              <li>End users on the project</li>
              <li>Supervisors</li>
              <li>Engineers project director</li>
              <li>Senior leadership team</li>
              <li>Sometimes Managers outside of the project</li>
              <li>John holland corporate IT</li>
            </ul>
            Cleve adds specifically in IT fields he interacts with:
            <ul>
              <li>John Holland Data analytics team</li>
              <li>John Holland Cloud team</li>
              <li>John Holland Systems team</li>
              <li>John Holland security team</li>
            </ul>
            Cleve concluded that these groups were the main and most consistent stakeholders he interacts 
            with within his day-to-day responsibilities. 
          </p>
              
          <h3>
            Question 5: What are your investor and client interactions if any? 
          </h3>
          <p>
            Cleve explains that he has not had dealings with investors in his role but instead works 
            closely with external clients. The project Systems Manager ensures clients have IT systems 
            in place whereby clients and John Holland can interact and communicate. 
            They have developed:  
            <ul>
             <li>Access Systems</li> 
             <li>Security systems</li>  
             <li>API interfaces for Client and John Holland Systems to communicate</li> 
            </ul>

          <h3>
            Question 6: What do you mostly spend your time on in your role? 
          </h3>
          <p>
            Cleve explains that the Project Systems Manager’s responsibilities are divided against all the 
            duties listed in question 1. However, he expresses that Data Analytics and Reporting consume most 
            of his allocated time. In a way this allows Cleve to make sure the systems are working properly 
            for the project and reducing potential systems downtime and correctly aligning the systems 
            functionality to the needs of the project. 
          </p>

          <h3>
            Question 7: What are the most common complaints about job and industry? 
          </h3>
          <p>
            Cleve highlights the most common key complaints he has about the industry: 
            <ul>
             <li>
               Lack of digitalization. There is still a lot of paper processes and is worried that the industry 
               is too resistant in some areas to change, adapt and get up to speed with today’s technology. 
             </li>  
             <li>
               The IT systems that are available from the enterprise are no where near as innovative or fluid 
               as the programs found in the app store or google play. They are designed for extremely specific 
               uses and adapting them to projects has proven extremely challenging sometimes. 
             </li>   
             <li>
               The construction industry is resistant to implementing technology advancements. He estimated 
               the common processes and technology being used has been completed removed form the manufacturing 
               industry at least ten years prior. 
             </li>   
            </ul>
            “There’s definitely challenges there where enterprise systems have to adapt really quickly and 
            innovate in that space.” He explains that the industry is quite resistant to technology implementation, 
            “I was in manufacturing twelve years ago, and we’re still doing stuff in construction that manufacturing 
            have long since gotten rid of.” 
          </p>            

          <h3>
            Question 8: What is the most challenging part of the job? 
          </h3>
          <p>
            Cleve concludes that the key responsibility is the most challenging part. As he discussed previously, 
            the systems available are quite rigid and purpose specific which constantly affects Cleve’s ability to deliver 
            his responsibility to the project teams. This affects Cleve is when he is developing systems to meet the 
            project requirements, specifically:           
            <ul>
              <li>fields </li> 
              <li>workflows </li> 
              <li>flexibility of the system </li> 
            </ul>
            Cleve mentions that often he is unable to match a system perfectly to a team and as a result the project teams 
            face compromise and it is up to Cleve to and sell the IT solution to them, making sure it does complete 
            everything they need it to do, as best it can. 
          </p>

          <h3>
            Question 9: What skills or experience have you brought to this role? 
          </h3>
          <p>
            Cleve outlines his work experience in the industry, previous manufacturing industry, document control, 
            shop-floor experience, support roles and worked on applications. He remarks, “A lot of those previous experience 
            and just the process knowledge helps in the role a lot.” He continues by saying, “I definitely use those daily.” 
          </p>
  
          <h3>
            Question 10: What is your best advice for new people to come to the IT field? 
          </h3>
          <p>
            Cleve begins to explain that IT is a very broad field and general advice for new people is probably not feasible. 
            He then goes on to talk about some concepts that he thinks new people should focus their learning on: 
            <ul>
              <li>Research</li>
              <li>Development of skills </li>
              <li>Development of demonstrated learning and experience. </li>
            </ul>
            He continues, “It depends on what you want to do: there’s Systems, Applications, there’s security, there’s so many 
            different elements.” 

            Cleve talks about his personal experience and discusses how devoting personal time to develop things for yourself 
            can yield quite good learning results and build some experience. Cleve advises, “Actually build something or develop 
            something, code something just in your own time just using something that interest you.”
