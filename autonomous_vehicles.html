          <p>
            An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of operating with limited or no human intervention, depending on its level of automation. 
            The Society of Automotive Engineers defines 6 levels of driving automation.  At Level 0 there is no automation. At Level 1 driver 
            the vehicle features single automated systems like cruise control. At level 2 some tasks are automated such as lane assist, 
            adaptive cruise control that accelerates, and brakes depending on the distance from another car. At level 3 vehicles have 
            “environmental detection” capabilities and can make informed decisions for themselves the vehicle will perform most tasks and 
            will notify when the human should resume control. Level 4 vehicles are almost entirely autonomous however a driver is still 
            required to aid when complex environments are encountered. Level 5 vehicles do not require human attention. The autonomous 
            vehicle is made possible through the development of several technologies including sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, 
            machine learning systems, and powerful processors all used to help sense and interpret information in the vehicle’s environment. 
            Sensors including radar, ultrasonic, and Lidar ranging sensors are situated around the vehicle. They are responsible for 
            creating and maintaining a map of their surroundings and monitoring the position of other vehicles. Lidar sensors bounce 
            pulses of light off the car to determine distances, edges of the road, and lanes. Video cameras detect road signs, traffic lights 
            and look for obstacles or pedestrians. The software then processes this sensory input and sends instructions to the actuators 
            which control acceleration, braking, and steering. Hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance algorithms, predictive modeling, and 
            object recognition help the software follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles (Synopsys, 2019).

            Technology is available to achieve most levels of automation however, due to significant barriers mainstream production has not 
            surpassed Level 2 automation.  At this level, your vehicle can detect its lane and correct the vehicle if it veers off the road 
            “Lane assist”. There is also partial automation of steering including parking assist and control of speed through adaptive cruise 
            control. At this level, there is still a requirement for the driver to keep their hands on the wheel and pay full attention to 
            the road. If the vehicle senses the driver has removed their hands from the wheel for too long it will alert the driver, turn
            off automation, and if needed will make a safe stop (Synopsys, 2019). Recently Honda announced a level 3 automated vehicle which 
            will be made available in Japan. This vehicle will be capable of conditional automation whereby it can self-drive but will still 
            prompt the driver to take control if needed. Level 4 automation is currently available however significant testing is still 
            required before they are made commercially available. The only cars with level four automation are Waymo One Robotaxis which operate 
            within a 50 square mile area in Arizona and only in limited conditions (Brase, 2021).  
          </p>

            Currently, level 4 and 5 vehicles are being developed but are not currently commercially available. Soon, it is expected that 
            autonomous vehicles will reach level 5 full automation. This means the vehicle will be capable of driving completely independently 
            and require no human interaction besides selecting a location. In fact, prototypes suggest level 5 cars won’t have steering wheels, 
            acceleration, or braking pedals and in fact the design of the car in some cases re-defined. However, there are several challenges to 
            overcome before this is possible including limitations to the technology, legislation, significant security issues, and barriers to 
            public adoption. Limitations with sensors need to be overcome as currently, it is unknown if signals from lidar sensors would interfere 
            with other autonomous vehicles. There are also significant issues with level 4 and 5 vehicles being unable to detect their environment 
            if heavy rain or snow makes markers not visible. Public perception is another issue with questions about security and ethics difficult 
            to overcome. When programming self-driving cars we are also faced with many ethical dilemmas, in the case of an emergency should the 
            car value the life of the passengers or the pedestrians more. Cybersecurity is another concern because if driverless vehicles were 
            hacked, they could cause significant harm to others.  For these reasons, federal regulation is tightening on this industry and causing 
            rightly significant delays in vehicles being commercially available in most places (Synopsys, 2019).

            There are many impacts the development of this technology will have on society. There would be health and safety benefits, with 
            accident-avoidance technology resulting in a decrease in accidents and fatalities. A recent study found that autonomous vehicles have the 
            potential to reduce motor vehicle deaths by 90 percent, saving thousands of lives. There would also be financial benefits, as driverless 
            cars become available people may move to a fleet vehicle model, where individuals would share cars and call them like an Uber when needed. 
            This would eliminate costs associated with car ownership including registration, maintenance, and purchasing. The cost associated with 
            transporting goods would decrease resulting in lower prices for products. There would also be benefits for disabled, elderly, or unlicensed 
            drivers to have access to reliable transport. Commuters will also have shorter commutes due to traffic jam alleviating technology which 
            increases the efficiency in traffic flow. The journey should also be much more enjoyable for the rider who can undertake other activities 
            while commuting. Urban planners also predict more affordable housing as a fleet model would result in fewer carparks freeing up more. 
            There are unintended consequences that will result from the adoption of driverless cars. The most obvious is the potential loss of 
            millions of driving jobs. If cars, trucks, and buses start driving themselves people who earn their living from driving will suddenly 
            find themselves out of a work. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that represents a potential loss of more than 4.5 million 
            jobs. As more individuals rely on shared cars there will be a decline in car ownership resulting in the loss of automotive jobs. With fewer 
            accidents and cars on the road and some manufacturers such as Google, Mercedes moving to self-insured liability models to cover technical 
            failures the insurance industry will be decimated (Hayes, 2019).

            Personally, the development of automated cars would have many positive benefits in my daily life. As the affordability of Level 2 and 3 
            vehicles improves, I would be able to benefit from their features soon. Features including the lane assist, adaptive cruise control, and 
            parking assists are all features not available in my current car. These features are attractive living in central Melbourne where parking 
            is tricky, and accidents are common. When self-driving cars become available, I will benefit from increased safety from accident-avoidance 
            technology. As a Fleet model becomes available, I would see many financial benefits including no longer needing to register, upkeep or 
            insure my car. The elimination of the need for parking would be a very attractive prospect for me, living in Melbourne in a non-permit 
            parking area is a daily struggle.  Living some distance from my work and needing to travel 5 days a week I would see great improvements 
            in my quality of life also. Instead of spending an hour staring at a road, I could complete life admin or even just relax. This also 
            applies to when I visit my family who all live 4 hours away.  My hopes are that the current predictions regarding urban planning come into 
            reality with more land available I am hoping that my generation will benefit from better housing affordability. For my family who lives 
            in a regional town, they would benefit greatly from self-driving cars as services like Uber don’t exist and public transport is limited 
            traveling can be difficult.
